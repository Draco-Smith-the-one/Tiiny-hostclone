### What to do if it fails again:
If it fails after these changes, please scroll down in the Vercel log until you see a line in **Red text** or a line that says **"Failed to compile."** The lines right below that will tell us exactly which line number and which character is the problem.

**Common Culprits to look for in the log:**
* `Module not found: Can't resolve './App'` (This means the file name is slightly different).
* `Parsing error: Unexpected token` (This means a bracket `{` or `}` is missing).

**Once you update `src/index.js` to explicitly look for `./App.jsx`, try the build one more time!**
